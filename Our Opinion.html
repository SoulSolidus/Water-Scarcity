            <p>Water scarcity is a natural phenomenon, but also a human-induced phenomenon. Although there is enough fresh water on the planet to meet the needs of a world population of approximately seven billion people, its distribution is uneven in both time and space, and much of it is wasted, polluted and managed in ways untenable. There is no water shortage in the world as such, but there are a series of regions in the world that suffer from water shortages, this because the use of this resource has more than doubled in relation to the population growth rate in the last century. <br> <br>

                Water scarcity is a global problem that has very serious consequences for both the environment and people. Also for many countries the most urgent challenge for socioeconomic and human development in general. <br> <br>

                Something as everyday as opening a tap and running water so that we can drink when we are thirsty or want to wash, is very complicated for millions of people who suffer the consequences of water scarcity in the world.It is in our power to take care of and not waste this resource so necessary for life. <br> <br>

                A change in the way things are managed is needed if we want to optimize people's lives and reduce pollution and therefore water scarcity. Thousands of people have died because of this mismanagement. It is time for a change in things because thousands of people will continue to die and the world will continue to decline. Incentivizing water management and sustainability is one of the best measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of water pollution and scarcity.
